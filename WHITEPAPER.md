**Released: November 2025**
## Executive Summary
USDT.z (Tether USD Bridged ZED20) represents a sophisticated solution for cross-chain stablecoin
liquidity. As a BEP-20 compliant token deployed on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), USDT.z provides
seamless bridging of USDT liquidity to the BSC ecosystem while maintaining the stability and trust of
the original USDT standard. With its 200 million token supply and 8-decimal precision, USDT.z offers
traders, DeFi protocols, and institutional investors a reliable medium of exchange, store of value, and
unit of account within the BSC ecosystem. ## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 The Stablecoin Challenge
Stablecoins have emerged as the backbone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, providing a crucial
bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. However, fragmentation across blockchains has
created liquidity silos and friction in the system. Users face high gas fees, slow transaction times, and
complex bridging mechanisms when moving between ecosystems. ### 1.2 The USDT.z Solution
USDT.z is designed to solve these challenges through: - **Cross-chain compatibility**: Seamless bridging between Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain
- **1:1 USD peg**: Maintaining a strict peg to the US dollar
- **BSC-native performance**: Leveraging BSC's high throughput and low-cost transactions
- **DeFi integration**: Full compatibility with BSC-based DeFi protocols
- **Transparency**: On-chain verification of reserves and bridging mechanisms
### 1.3 Key Features
- **Fixed supply**: 200,000,000 USDT.z tokens with 8 decimal places
- **BEP-20 compliant**: Full compatibility with BSC ecosystem
- **Verified contract**: Fully audited and verified smart contract
- **Zero fees**: No transaction fees for transfers (standard gas fees apply) - **Instant finality**: Transactions confirmed within seconds on BSC
- **Eco-friendly**: Significantly lower energy consumption compared to Ethereum mainnet

3. **Burn**: When USDT.z is returned to the bridge, it is burned
4. **Unlock**: Equivalent USDT is unlocked on Ethereum
## 5.2 Bridge Security
The bridging mechanism employs: - **Multi-signature wallets**: Requiring multiple signatures for large transfers
- **Timelocks**: Delayed execution for security-critical operations
- **Transparency**: All bridging events are recorded on-chain
- **Gradual decentralization**: Moving toward a decentralized validator set over time
